# Azure App Onboard Prereq — Repository Evaluation

Evaluate a user's repository for build health, app completeness, and Azure deployment feasibility — before infrastructure planning. Produces per-component verdicts (PASS/WARN/FAIL) consumed by downstream phases.

> **Orchestrator relationship:** Called by `azure-app-onboard` at Step 3, or standalone for code readiness checks. When called by orchestrator, return control to `azure-app-onboard` after writing artifacts — do NOT invoke downstream phases directly.

Phase 1 of 4 in AppOnboard pipeline. Session: `.copilot-azure/sessions/{session-id}/`. Reads `context.json`. Writes `components[]`, `repo{}`, `detectedInfra[]`. Produces `prereq-output.json`. Schema: [`prereq-schemas.ts`](./references/prereq-schemas.ts) — `PrereqOutput`, `BuildRequirements`. Direct entry supported.

## When NOT to Use

| Signal | Redirect |
|--------|----------|
| Validate infrastructure (Bicep/TF/azure.yaml) | **azure-validate** |
| Generate IaC | **azure-prepare** |
| End-to-end idea-to-production | **azure-app-onboard** |
| Run `azd up` or deploy | **azure-deploy** |

## Rules

> ⛔ **ABSOLUTE PROHIBITION — `npm install`, `npm test`, `npx jest`, `pytest`, and ALL install/build/test commands are NEVER allowed.**
> Under NO circumstances may you run `npm install`, `npm test`, `npx jest`, `pip install`, `pytest`, `dotnet build`, `dotnet restore`, `dotnet test`, `go mod download`, `cargo build`, or ANY package-manager install, build, or test command during the prereq phase. Do NOT run test suites to verify code — check for test config files statically instead. The prereq phase is read-only evaluation + static-only verification.
> **ONLY exception — two sanctioned contexts, both consent-gated:** (a) code the agent **modified** during migration/remediation (see [remediation-protocol.md](./references/remediation-protocol.md) step 6), or (b) code the agent **wrote** from scratch on the zero-code path (see [zero-code-path.md](./references/zero-code-path.md)). In either case, install/build/test runs ONLY via the user-confirmed build-validation gate ([build-check.md](./references/build-check.md) Step 3), after the user answers that specific per-command consent prompt. General prior consent never counts.

1. ⛔ **Full pipeline (Steps 1–8), no exceptions.** All prompts → Step 1 directly. Answer specific questions AS PART OF findings (Step 5), not before.
2. ⛔ **No sub-agents for evaluation.** 3-axis evaluation is inline. **Exception**: zero-code-path scaffolding (Step 2).
3. Code/destructive modifications require `ask_user`. Max 3 questions before results. Direct entry: don't repeat orchestrator's intent questions.

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `mcp_azure_mcp_get_azure_bestpractices` | Validate detected stack patterns against Azure best practices |
| `mcp_azure_mcp_extension_cli_install` | Check/install required CLI tools (az, azd, func) |

## Workflow

### Step 1: Session Check

**Orchestrator entry:** Session exists — read `context.json`, proceed to Step 2.

**Direct entry:** Check `.copilot-azure/sessions/active-session.json`:
- **Exists** → ⛔ read [session-protocol.md](./references/session-protocol.md) for resume/fresh gate. Do NOT proceed until user answers.
- **Missing** → create session: generate UUID, `New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path ".copilot-azure/sessions/{uuid}" -Force`, write `context.json` + `active-session.json` via `create` tool.

Then: `az account show` → merge `{id, name, tenantId}` into `context.json.azure`. ⛔ Session MUST exist on disk before any scanning.

### Step 2: Scan Workspace

Scan for project files. Detect components, `repo{}`, `detectedInfra[]`, `detectedServices[]`. Classify Terraform providers. Check CLI availability. Stack detection conflicts: user explicit statement wins (write to `context.json`, mark scan as override); scan-only → confirm with user; multiple stacks → show all and ask (see [component-mapping.md](./references/component-mapping.md)); no code → [zero-code-path.md](./references/zero-code-path.md).

> If no project files, no Dockerfile, AND no index.html → ⛔ read [zero-code-path.md](./references/zero-code-path.md).

> ⛔ **Cloud SDK early gate.** Grep for `aws-sdk|@aws-sdk|boto3|google-cloud|@google-cloud|firebase`. If functional deps found → read [cloud-sdk-migration.md](./references/cloud-sdk-migration.md), then `ask_user`: **"Redirect to Azure Cloud Migrate"** (set `routeToSkill: "azure-cloud-migrate"`) · **"Continue evaluation anyway"** (finish readiness eval + SDK→Azure mapping, then STOP at Step 8 — no plan until the deps are swapped) · **"Cancel"**.

### Step 3: Per-Component Evaluation

| Sub-step | Action | Reference |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| 3.1 | **Build check** | ⛔ **You MUST read [build-check.md](./references/build-check.md)** |
| 3.2 | **Completeness check** | ⛔ **You MUST read [completeness-check.md](./references/completeness-check.md)** |
| 3.3 | **Deployability check** | ⛔ **You MUST read [deployability-check.md](./references/deployability-check.md)** |
| 3.3a | **Component mapping** (conditional) | Read [component-mapping.md](./references/component-mapping.md) ONLY IF >1 project manifest found (monorepo) |

Populate `buildRequirements` per component after evaluation. Verdict propagation, tier rules, and f1Viable aggregation are in [readiness-gate.md](./references/readiness-gate.md) and the individual check references.

### Step 4: Write Artifacts + Readiness Gate

⛔ Verify `context.json` exists on disk. Read [readiness-gate.md](./references/readiness-gate.md) (verdicts, tiers, batch-then-approve, fast-track) then [prereq-artifacts.md](./references/prereq-artifacts.md) (write procedures, schemas).

### Step 5: Present Findings

Per [readiness-gate.md § Present Findings](./references/readiness-gate.md) — show verdicts grouped by severity before proceeding.

### Step 6: Remediation (conditional)

⛔ **You MUST read [remediation-protocol.md](./references/remediation-protocol.md)** IF any ❌ FAIL verdict, 🔧 Recommended Fix, or ⚠️ WARN with `fixPhase: "prereq"` exists. Contains remediation loop, static verification, re-eval mandate, post-remediation artifact updates, and the build-validation consent gate. If all verdicts are ✅ PASS or ⚠️ WARN without `fixPhase: "prereq"`, skip to Step 7.

### Step 7: Write Final State

`completedPhases` already has `"prereq"` + `currentPhase: null` (from Step 4). Then:

> ⛔ **Write `lastScanCommit`.** Run `git rev-parse HEAD` and store the full 40-character SHA as `context.json.repo.lastScanCommit`. Required — staleness guard in Step 1 compares to HEAD on resume to detect changes.

### Step 8: Route

⛔ **Mandatory — do NOT skip this step.**

> **Routing fields:** All routing writes `routeToSkill` and `routeReason` to `context.json`.

> **Post-remediation context:** If Step 6 ran, lead the routing prompt with: "Remediation complete — {N} issues fixed, your app is now {overallHealth}."

> ⛔ **Evaluate rows top to bottom — first match wins.**

| # | Condition | Action |
|---|-----------|--------|
| 1 | `routeToSkill` set (any entry) | `ask_user`: "Redirect to {routeToSkill}" / "Not now". ⛔ Pipeline stops — do NOT proceed to architecture planning. |
| 2 | `cloudSdkFindings[]` non-empty (user chose "Continue evaluation anyway") | Present the cloud-SDK → Azure swap mapping as 🔶 blockers, then `ask_user` with this exact prompt: **"🔶 Cloud SDK migration required — these dependencies must be swapped before this app can deploy to Azure. (Redirect to azure-cloud-migrate / Stop — swap manually and re-run)"** — Redirect sets `routeToSkill: "azure-cloud-migrate"`, Stop halts. ⛔ Pipeline stops — do NOT proceed to architecture planning, and do NOT offer a "continue to prepare" option; the app can't deploy until the deps are swapped. |
| 3 | Orchestrator + no `routeToSkill` | Tell the user: "✅ Your app has been evaluated and is ready — let's plan your Azure deployment." Then invoke `azure-app-onboard`. ⛔ Do NOT stop, do NOT wait for user input, do NOT narrate internal handoffs. The user already consented to the full pipeline at scope triage. |
| 4 | Direct + ready/readyWithCaveats + no Azure infra | `ask_user`: "Deploy to Azure (full pipeline)" → invoke `azure-app-onboard` / "Not now" |
| 5 | Direct + ready/readyWithCaveats + existing Azure infra | `ask_user`: "Start fresh" → invoke `azure-app-onboard` / "Use existing infra" → invoke `azure-prepare` / "Not now" |
| 6 | Direct + blocked | Report blocker summary + "Fix and re-run." |

Severity tiers (🛑🔶❌🔧⚠️✅) are defined in [readiness-gate.md](./references/readiness-gate.md).

## Outputs

| Artifact | Location | Consumer |
